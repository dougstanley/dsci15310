Student Ethics and Other Policy Information
===========================================

University Policies
-------------------

Enrollment & registration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Students who are not officially registered for a course by published
University deadlines should not be attending classes and will not receive
credit or a grade for the course. Each student must confirm enrollment by
checking his/her class schedule (using Student Tools in FlashFast) prior to
the deadline indicated. Registration errors must be corrected prior to the
deadline.
 
*Last Day to Add:* **09/08/13**

See:

http://www.kent.edu/registrar/enrollment/reg_process.cfm

.. note:: Students who names do not appear on the University's official class
    roster by the registration deadline, will not be permitted to participate
    (participate in discussions, turn in homework, or receive credit). 

Plagiarism and Academic Integrity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Students enrolled in the university, at all its campuses, are to perform their
academic work according to standards set by faculty members, departments,
schools and colleges of the university; and cheating and plagiarism constitute
fraudulent misrepresentation for which no credit can be given and for which
appropriate sanctions are warranted and will be applied.
 
For more information: http://www.kent.edu/academics/resources/plagiarism/ 

Regarding Students with Disabilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(Revised 6/01/07) University policy 3342-3-01.3 requires that students with
disabilities be provided reasonable accommodations to ensure their equal
access to course content. If you have a documented disability and require
accommodations, please contact the instructor at the beginning of the semester
to make arrangements for necessary classroom adjustments. Please note, you
must first verify your eligibility for these through Student Accessibility
Services (contact 330-672-3391 or visit www.kent.edu/sas for more information
on registration procedures).


Course Policies 
----------------

Absences
~~~~~~~~

You may lose attendance points for every absence. If you can't make it to
class for any reason, contact the instructor prior to the class session.
Tests and Labs are to be taken on time. If you are unable to take a test or do
a Lab during the regularly scheduled class time, you must contact the
instructor before the test and have a valid excuse. There are NO make-up tests
or Labs!

Too many consecutively missed classes and assignments will lead to the filing
of a grade of SF (stopped attending Fail). The University wants to know as soon
as possible when a student stops attending. Therefore, if you know you will be
missing classes, please let me know a head of time. Also, a grade of SF can be
changed back to a normal grade, if you resume attending class and turning in
assignments. I will always try to contact you via email several times prior to
turning in a grade of SF as well.


Course Concerns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have any concerns, regarding anything related to the course, please
contact the instructor. 

Deadlines
~~~~~~~~~

It is your responsibility to meet all of the deadlines for every class
session, assignments, and assignment task. Assignments will be given
deadlines--ANY assignments not turned in on the designated due dates and
times, will be considered late and counted as a zero(0) for that assignment.


Ethics
~~~~~~

Students are expected to display ethical behavior at all times. Cheating,
plagiarism, etc., will not be tolerated. The consequences of dishonest
behavior will be commensurate with the activity to include, but not be limited
to, an 'F' for the class, dialogue with administrators, and dismissal from the
college.


Grades
~~~~~~

During the semester, I will track grades by point values of the various
assignments. Letter grades will not be calculated until the end of the
semester, and will use the previously mentioned grade scale.

It is up to you to keep track of your current approximate grade during the
semester, and to see me if you feel there is something wrong. Grades for
assignments will be tracked in blackboard.

Student grades will be submitted to the appropriate department at the end of
the semester (due dates for grades are determined by Kent State University).

Misc
~~~~

**STUDENTS ARE REQUIRED TO FOLLOW ALL LAB, DEPARTMENTAL, COLLEGE, AND
UNIVERSITY RULES AND REGULATIONS AND ALL LAWS.** It is the student's
responsibility to know, understand, and obey these rules, regulations, and
laws. Some of them include:

* All course prerequisites must be met. 

* Only registered students may attend class (no friends or children). 

* No plagiarism. 

.. note:: All cell phones, pagers, and other devices must be set to vibrate or
    turned off during class. The sound on laptop or other computers must be
    turned off during class. Students are expected to not interrupt when
    another person is talking and to not disrupt the class by talking to
    others when someone is presenting.  Students are not to use computers,
    PDAs, etc. for any purpose other than authorized class-related activities
    when class is in session.


.. note:: This Syllabus is subject to change at the instructor's discretion.
