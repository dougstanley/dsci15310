What is "Computational Thinking"?
=================================

Computational thinking, is more or less simply the application of techniques
from computer science and engineering to solve problems. Essentially, solving
a problem "Algorithmically", or applying common algorithms and patterns in
the search of a solution.


What exactly is an "Algorithm"?
===============================

Quite simply, and Algorithm is nothing more than a set of step by step
instructions. Typically, the goal of performing the instructions is to solve
a problem of some kind.

Movies and TV
-------------

I'm sure you've heard the term used before, probably even heard it used in
TV or movies. Probably used very vaguely, and still leaving you with some
question as to what it really means.

For example, I was watching the tv show "Numbers" a while ago, and it seemed
like every episode they mentioned either algorithms or algorithmically. But
most of the time, I'm not sure the writers were really using the terms
correctly. It almost felt like they were just using the word as some sort of
*magic* word, and I was almost expecting some one to waive their hands around
after saying it, much like a magician would.

I think in reality, they were just trying to use the word to be something 
bigger than it really is. It just sounds fancier than saying, "I created a
set of instructions to follow in order to solve this problem...".


Practical Examples of an Algorithm
==================================

* A recipe.

* What you get with your Ikea furniture

.. class:: handout


Think about Ikea
----------------

Yes, their meatballs are good, but that's not the point. Pretty much everything
you purchase from them, comes with a set of instructions (and screws to fasten
it to the wall). If you've ever put together furniture from Ikea, or any
furniture that came in a box, you'll be familiar with the paper instructions
that comes with it. These instructions lead you step by step in how to assemble
the furniture. If you follow them, with any luck, at the end, you'll have a
piece of furniture.

That is the problem to be solved...how to make furniture out of all those
individual pieces.

What is a "Program"
===================

* Set of instructions

* Gets converted into "machine language"

* High vs Low Level


.. class:: handout

High vs Low Level
-----------------

High level programming languages are meant for humans to write and understand
easily. Low level languages, are closer to what a machine would understand.
Not exactly what a machine would understand, but much closer.

Are Algorithms and Programs the same?
=====================================

No! They are interrelated though. Their concepts are similar, but it's more
correct to say that a program is a realization of an algorithm. This is a
kind of primitive way to look at it. Often times, a program will employ
many algorithms.

.. class:: handout

Algorithm vs Program Example
----------------------------

An algorithm is a set of steps to solve a problem. For example, the well known
pythagorean theorem for finding the length of sides of a triangle. That's an
algorithm. However, a program, say a drawing program, does much more than just
calculate triangles. However, in drawing shapes, the drawing program may need
to calculate the length of sides of a given triangle.

So, as you can see, the relationship between an algorithm and a program is more
complex. Also, it might be feasible to assume that some one may write a program
that simply implements a specific algorithm, and nothing more. In that case,
the program would basically be the realization of the given algorithm.
